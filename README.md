# File I/O Cleaner

A basic script that can clean any given folder and sort it into Year > Month > Extension File Type. 

My download folder and desktop usually becomes messy - and I often need to come back to it in future. 
Thus I've created a small script which runs on a schedule to clean my download folder. In essence it works with any given
target folder.
